# azimuth_vector_calculator
This API provides functions to calculate azimuthal vectors in spherical, polar and cartesian coordinates for C

An azimuth vector is a vector that points in the direction of a specific azimuth, which is defined as the angle between a reference direction and the direction of the vector. The reference direction is usually a fixed direction, such as due north or true north.

In the context of navigation or celestial mechanics, an azimuth vector is often used to represent the direction of an object relative to a reference direction. For example, an azimuth vector could be used to represent the direction of a satellite relative to the horizon, or the direction of a star relative to the celestial pole.

In mathematics, an azimuth vector is often represented as a complex number, with the real part representing the projection of the vector onto the reference direction and the imaginary part representing the projection of the vector onto a direction perpendicular to the reference direction. The magnitude of the azimuth vector is equal to the distance from the origin to the point represented by the vector.

Azimuth Vectors are primarly used in the fields of navigation, celestial mechanics, geospatial analysis and robotics
